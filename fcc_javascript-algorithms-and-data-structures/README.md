## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification projects.

1. **Palindrome Checker-** an algorithm insensitive to casing and non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) used to check if a given string is a palindrome or not.

2. **Roman Numeral Converter-** an algorithm to convert an integer into its equivalent roman numeral representation.

3. **Caesars Cipher-** an algorithm to decipher a ROT13 cipher or any Caesars Cipher with a different shift value.

4. **Telephone Number Validator-** an algorithm to validate or reject US phone numbers depending on their format.

5. **Cash Register-** an algorithm to calculate the change due in coins and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order, with respect to the change owed and the available cash in the drawer. The register will obtain a status of INSUFFICIENT FUNDS (if the register cash is insufficient), CLOSED (if the register cash is equal to change owed), or OPEN (if the register cash is more than the change owed).
