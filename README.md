## Certification Projects for freeCodeCamp courses.

This repository contains the codes I've personally implemented to complete the freeCodeCamp certification projects in each freeCodeCamp course. I welcome anyone to view its contents in the name of learning and curiosity.

However, if your intentions are to use this code to bypass your personal learning process and quickly complete the courses with minimal effort, I strongly urge you to to refrain from doing so. Aside from being unethical, you're also limiting your limitless capacity to learn and improve as a human being. So do the right thing!

Happy coding :)
